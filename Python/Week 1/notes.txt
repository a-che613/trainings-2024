# Data types in python include:

  1. Numeric Types:
    - Integer values (int); e.g 10, -3...
    - Floating-point (float); e.g 2.14, -0.01...
    - Complex e.g 1+2j...
  
  2. Sequence Types:
    - String, str (a sequence of characters); e.g "hello world"..
    - List, array (ordered, mutable collection); e.g [1,2,3]...
    - Tuple (ordered, immutable collection); e.g (1,2,3)...
  3. Mapping Type:
    - dict, dictionary, object (a collection of key-value pairs); e.g {"name": "Alex"}...

  4. Set Types:
    - set (unordered collection of unique elements); e.g {1,2,3}...
    - frozenset (immutable version of a set)..

  5. Boolean



  NB: Python is a dynamically typed language, meaning you don't need to explicitly declare the data type of a variable when you create it, python automatically determines the type of a variable based on the value assigned to it at run time. This is opposed to statically typed languages whose variable types need to be specified at compile time.


  # Type casting.
    The process of converting a variable from one data type to another.
